      <p>"Sabna's workouts and personalized diet plans helped me shred fat and gain muscle. I feel like a new person!"<br>
         "When I started training with Sabna, I weighed over 90 kg and struggled with energy, confidence, and consistency. I had tried many fitness plans before, but nothing ever stuck. Sabna‚Äôs approach was different‚Äîstructured workouts, a sustainable diet plan, and constant motivation. Over 12 weeks, I lost 12 kg of fat, gained lean muscle, and completely changed my lifestyle. Now, I wake up feeling energized, proud of my progress, and more focused in every area of my life. This transformation has been more than just physical‚Äîit‚Äôs been mental and emotional too. I‚Äôm forever thankful."</p>

      <h4>Priya ‚Äì 8 Weeks Transformation</h4>
      <p>"I used to feel tired all the time. With Sabna‚Äôs training and guidance, I lost 6kg and gained confidence and energy. Forever grateful!"<br>"Before joining Sabna‚Äôs program, I lacked self-discipline and felt insecure about my body. I had no idea where to start, and working out felt intimidating. But Sabna made everything easy to follow and gave me the courage to push myself. She created a balanced meal plan that suited my vegetarian lifestyle and guided me through every workout. In just 8 weeks, I lost 6 kg, toned my body, and gained so much confidence. Now, I look in the mirror and smile‚Äînot just because of how I look, but because I feel strong, capable, and proud of myself."</p>
