76) Write a simple 'birthday countdown' script, the script will count the number of days 
between current day and birthday. 
<?php 
// Set your birthday (month and day only) 
$birthdayMonth = 12; 
$birthdayDay = 25; 
// Get today's date 
$today = new DateTime(); 
$currentYear = (int) $today->format('Y'); 
// Create birthday date for this year 
$birthday = DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d', "$currentYear-$birthdayMonth
$birthdayDay"); 
// If birthday has already passed this year, use next year 
if ($birthday < $today) { 
$birthday->modify('+1 year'); 
} 
// Calculate difference 
$interval = $today->diff($birthday); 
$daysLeft = $interval->days; 
// Display 
echo "          
?> 
Your birthday is in <strong>$daysLeft</strong> day(s)!"; 
OUTPUT:
