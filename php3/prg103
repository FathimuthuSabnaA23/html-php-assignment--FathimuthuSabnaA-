103) Create a very simple pageview counter by using ‘isset’ to check if the pageview variable 
has already been created. 
<?php 
session_start(); 
if (isset($_SESSION['pageviews'])) { 
$_SESSION['pageviews']++; 
} else { 
$_SESSION['pageviews'] = 1; 
} 
echo "You have viewed this page " . $_SESSION['pageviews'] . " time(s) in this session."; 
?> 
Output: 
You have viewed this page 1 time(s) in this session.
