39)A school wants to automate the calculation of student grades. Design a system that allows
teachers to input student scores, calculates their grades, and generates a summary report. How
would you utilize arrays and array functions to store and process the student data effectively?
<?php
$students = [
["name" => "Divya", "score" => 85],
["name" => "Priya", "score" => 72],
["name" => "Arun", "score" => 91]
];
function getGrade($score) {
if ($score >= 90) return "A";
elseif ($score >= 75) return "B";
elseif ($score >= 60) return "C";
elseif ($score >= 50) return "D";
else return "F";
}
$students = array_map(function($s) {
$s["grade"] = getGrade($s["score"]);
return $s;
}, $students);
$scores = array_column($students, "score");
$average = array_sum($scores) / count($scores);
print_r($students);
echo "Class Average: $average";
?>
output:
Student Grade Report
Name: Divya | Score: 85 | Grade: B
Name: Priya | Score: 72 | Grade: C
Name: Arun| Score: 91 | Grade: A
Class average: 82.66666
