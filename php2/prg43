criteria: at least 8 characters long, contains at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter,
one digit, and one special character.
<?php
$pattern = "/^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$/";
$password = "Test@123";
if (preg_match($pattern, $password)) {
echo "Valid Password";
} else {
echo "Invalid Password";
}

$password = "Test@123";
