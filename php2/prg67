67) Construct a program that tokenizes a sentence into words using regular expressions.
Then, count the number of occurrences of each word and display the results.
<?php
$sentence = "PHP is great and PHP is easy to learn";
$words = preg_split('/\W+/', strtolower($sentence), -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY);
$wordCount = array_count_values($words);
echo "Sentence: $sentence\n";
print_r($wordCount);
?>
output:
Sentence: PHP is great and PHP is easy to learn
Array
(
[php] => 2
[is] => 2
[great] => 1
[and] => 1
[easy] => 1
[to] => 1

)
