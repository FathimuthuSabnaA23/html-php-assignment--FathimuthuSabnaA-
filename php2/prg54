54) Design a PHP program that simulates a ticket booking queue using built-in array
functions.
<?php
$queue = array();
array_push($queue, "Ticket1", "Ticket2", "Ticket3");
echo "Current Queue: ";
print_r($queue);
echo "<br>";
echo "Processing: " . array_shift($queue) . "<br>";
echo "Remaining Queue: ";
print_r($queue);
?>
output:
Current Queue: Array ( [0] => Ticket1 [1] => Ticket2 [2] => Ticket3 )
Processing: Ticket1
Remaining Queue: Array ( [0] => Ticket2 [1] => Ticket3 )
